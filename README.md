# AutoSuggest
C program to auto suggest words using Trie data structure.

The input dictionary file is added in the repository as well.

In the console, the user should first specify the number of queries he chooses to enter. Later on, for every query the user should input a word to the program (with no special characters embedded). The program then builds a trie data structure from the input dictionary and queries it to find similar words. If the construction of Trie is not considered for performance calculations, then the program suggests all the similar words in linear time proportional to the length of the input query string.
